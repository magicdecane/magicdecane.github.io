<p>I’m regularly asked for product manager book recommendations. There are lots of excellent books, but these are the ones I’d consider essential to any PM’s bookshelf.</p>
<p><em>The titles link to Amazon.com through their affiliate program. I donate all proceeds to charity and also match the donation on a two-for-one basis.</em></p>
<p><strong>Al Ries and Jack Trout, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1eLL8"><em>Positioning</em></a></strong><br/>
The classic marketing book, one of the first to specifically address positioning your product in a consumer’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Grove, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwAmbz"><em>High Output Management</em></a></strong><br/>
This one only gets better with age. Although it’s only mentioned briefly, this is where Andy Grove first introduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/https://www.gv.com/lib/how-google-sets-goals-objectives-and-key-results-okrs">OKRs</a> to the world. His practical advice about meetings, especially the importance of 1-on-1s, inspired <a href="/web/20160304024612/https://www.kennorton.com/essays/meetings-that-dont-suck.html">my own writing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Horowitz, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwBegg"><em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em></a></strong><br/>
The most truly practical management book. Ben cuts through the B.S. and addresses the messy ambiguity of the real world in entertaining fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette Jiwa, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwCLmq"><em>Meaningful: the Story of Ideas that Fly</em></a></strong><br/>
A new addition to this list, marketing as storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Clayton Christensen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1efN7"><em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwBOus"><em>The Innovator’s Solution</em></a></strong><br/>
The most important business book of the past fifty years and its equally essential follow-up. If you’re a technology PM and you haven’t read Christensen, do so right now.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Ariely, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1fpIt"><em>Predictably Irrational</em></a></strong><br/>
One of the best books on human nature, Ariely’s enjoyable book helps us understand why people behave irrationally.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Olsen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1fqwf"><em>The Lean Product Playbook</em></a></strong><br/>
Dan’s book is a perfect companion to <em>Lean Startup</em>, with lots of tactical advice and techniques for putting lean methodologies into practice.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Kahneman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1eQhT"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a></strong><br/>
When does our animal brain make decisions for us before our more analytical brain has a chance to think through the consequences? From Nobel laureate Kahneman, this is one of the most important psychology books ever written.</p>
<p><strong>David Allen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1fcoL"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a></strong><br/>
Soon after this book was published Allen attracted an almost cult-like following. PMs juggle hundreds of priorities, and this book will help you balance your time.</p>
<p><strong>Donald Norman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwBUlR"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a></strong><br/>
After you read Norman’s book you’ll notice design everywhere, both good and bad. A classic in the field of design.</p>
<p><strong>Ed Catmull, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1JrrnwA"><em>Creativity, Inc</em></a> <img src="/web/20160304024612im_/https://www.kennorton.com/img/new.gif" style="display: inline;"/></strong><br/>
If you appreciated my essay <a href="/web/20160304024612/https://www.kennorton.com/essays/10x-not-10-percent.html">10x Not 10%</a>, you’ll enjoy Catmull’s book about putting 10x into practice. He draws from the success – and failures – of Pixar to teach us how to lead creative teams.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Ries, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwBBHu"><em>The Lean Startup</em></a></strong><br/>
This book started a revolution in product development, and introduced us to the now-ubiquitous concepts of the MVP and the pivot.</p>
<p><strong>Frederick Brooks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1eyHT"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></a></strong><br/>
If you could only read one computer science book, this would be it. More than forty years old, it’s as relevant as ever. I promise you’ll nod your head as Brooks skewers mistakes that engineering leaders continue to make to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Geoffrey Moore, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwCxf2"><em>Crossing the Chasm</em></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1eS9r"><em>Inside the Tornado</em></a></strong><br/>
The classic technology marketing books. Moore was the first to evaluate the role of early adopters.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Knapp, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1fwnv"><em>Sprint</em></a></strong><br/>
Upcoming book from my partners in GV Design. How to cut through the crap, identify a problem, and test it in only one week.</p>
<p><strong>Laszlo Bock, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1f2O7"><em>Work Rules!</em></a></strong><br/>
Laszlo and his team at Google have reinvented the role of human resources. This book is a terrific overview of what makes Google Google, from culture, to hiring, to making decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Cagan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1evf2"><em>Inspired</em></a></strong><br/>
Marty has had a long and storied product management career, and is the founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://www.svpma.org/">SVPMA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nir Eyal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1f74n"><em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em></a></strong><br/>
Why do some products take hold while others quietly fail? Highly recommended for anyone building consumer products.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1PFJ5id"><em>Nudge</em></a></strong><br/>
In product development, defaults matter. Thaler’s is the best book on why that is, and how to steer your users in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Fisher and William Ury, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1fhIV"><em>Getting To Yes</em></a></strong><br/>
PMs need to be master negotiators and there’s no better guide to negotiation than this classic.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Krug, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwCgZJ"><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em></a></strong><br/>
This lighthearted book about user interface design is fun to read, and chock full of lessons for PMs.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen King, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1NwCFvb"><em>On Writing</em></a></strong><br/>
Product managers need to be good writers, and this is how you learn from one of the masters of the craft.</p>
<p><strong>Susan Cain, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1N1eDLA"><em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts</em></a></strong><br/>
I’m an introvert and I spent years treating it as a weakness. Susan’s book opened my eyes to the unique contributions introverts make. Even if you’re not an introvert yourself, I guarantee you work with lots of them.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Isaacson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024612/http://amzn.to/1OIOyDv"><em>Steve Jobs</em></a></strong><br/>
One of the best biographies of all time, of the greatest product manager of all time.</p>
