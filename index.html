<H1>Repo list files</H1>
<P>
Welcome to magicdecane.github.io repo list, hope there might be any of interest here. The list is mainly a collection of files I myself would like to have accessible to read.
<P>
These files are arranged alphabetically, not in any order of importance.

A good portion of the "General" boards you see listed were in fact Phreak or Pirate boards. Keeping an active account on all your local systems could be quite time-consuming.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="actung.hum">actung.hum</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 332<BR><TD> <B>Relaxen und watch das blinkenlights...</B><BR><I>This sort of small, quaint humor file could be found lurking across many different kinds of BBSes and mainframes. Origin: Unknown, although it very likely could date back to the 60's or 70's.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="ad.txt">ad.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 1664<BR><TD> <B>Call The Upside Down BBS!</B><BR><I>A typical "Tag File" for a Bulletin Board System, in this case a classic Apple II with 64k of memory. To entice you over, the BBS offers you everything up to and including the two floppy disks located in the floppy drives. Besides being an interesting approach for a BBS ad, this short file also shows the variety of devices you could hook to an Apple II, including devices you could hook to other devices.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="adventur.txt">adventur.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 7758<BR><TD> <B>Adventure: Solving it in Easy Steps, by The Rom Raider and Doctor Digital</B><BR><I>Don't read this file if you haven't played Crowther and Wood's original classic "Adventure"! This file is a solid example of a "Walk-through", where the goal was to present an easy, no-thinking solution to the classic thinking person's game: text adventures. While these games could present hours (or days or weeks) of fun trying to solve the puzzles and pitfalls, many people were content to just be given the answer and go through the game blindly, watching as every step they made was the exact right one. To a smaller degree, there was a constant one-upsmanship with Walkthroughs, where whoever could come out with the "solve" for a game the soonest after it was released (or even before) was the King of the Hill.</I><BR>&nbsp
