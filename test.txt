WELDING-Wire
      M.I.G.(Metal Inert Gas) - Points to Remember
                                                                 

                                                                 

      1. Mig (GMAW) welding is often referred to
         by the manufacturer's trade name as Micro-wire,
         Aircomatic, Sigma, and Millermatic Welding.
                                                                 

      2. Mig welding is faster than stick electrode
         welding and is much easier to learn.
